# Lava

> ðŸš§ Lava is currently in Development ðŸš§

Lava is a minimalist static site generator for Obsidian Vaults.

Heavily inspired by [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) but not happy configuration how its used. But unlike Quartz, Lava will be heavily opinionated (still configurable) and simpler to use and update.

## Usage

Lava will only require two things:

- The cli installed
- The `lava.toml` file in the root of your obsidian vault.
